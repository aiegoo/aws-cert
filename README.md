## Contents

### Machine Learning on AWS (`mla/`)

This directory contains resources focused on machine learning engineering practices and implementation on Amazon Web Services.

- **ML Engineering on AWS.pdf**: A comprehensive document covering machine learning engineering practices, best practices, and implementation strategies on AWS platform. This appears to be the main reference material for ML engineering certification or training.

- **ML Engineering on AWS.pdf:Zone.Identifier**: This is a metadata file created by Windows systems to track the security zone from which the PDF file was downloaded. This file is typically hidden and used by Windows security features.

## Purpose

This repository appears to be organized for AWS certification study, specifically focusing on:
- Machine Learning Engineering on AWS
- AWS best practices for ML workflows
- Certification preparation materials

## Usage

1. The main study material is the PDF document in the `mla/` directory
2. Use this repository to track your progress through AWS ML certification materials
3. Add additional resources, notes, or practice materials as needed

## Notes

- The `.pdf:Zone.Identifier` file is a Windows security metadata file and can be safely ignored on Linux/Mac systems
- Consider adding practice labs, code samples, or additional study notes to enhance this repository
